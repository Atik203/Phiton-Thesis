Summary:
ToolGate is a forward-execution framework that replaces natural-language reasoning about *when to call tools* with formal Hoare-style contracts. It maintains an explicit typed symbolic state *S = {(k,v,type)}* representing trusted world information, and formalizes each tool as `{P} T {Q}` where precondition *P* gates invocation (is *S ⊨ P*?) and postcondition *Q* gates commitment (does tool result *r* satisfy *Q* and type-correctly update *S* via deterministic update operator?). A retrieval-reranking front end (Qwen3-embedding-0.6B + Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B, Top-k) shrinks thousands of tools to candidates, then contracts filter candidates to a logically valid policy (renormalized) and verification gates state updates — unverified results are discarded, not propagated. Trajectory-level safety is proved (if all contracts sound and *S₀ ⊨ Inv*, every reachable trajectory is safe, Eq 21). Evaluated on ToolBench (16,464 APIs, 49 categories, G1/G2/G3) and MCP-Universe (231 tasks on 11 real MCP servers, 6 domains with Format/Static/Dynamic evaluators), ToolGate is best across 4 LLM backbones (Qwen3-235B, DeepSeek V3.2, GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro) — e.g., GPT-5.2 G1 85.5/83.5 (Pass/Win) vs ToolChain* 82.8/80, MCP-Universe avg 57.0 vs 51.5 — with more concise trajectories. Ablations show Hoare is the driver: w/o Hoare 37.6% MCP-Avg vs DFSDT 38.3% (worse), removing pre-check −10.8% vs post-check −4.5%; fine-grained rejection is 29.4% (17.6% pre: 8.4% hallucination, 5.1% schema, 4.1% dependency; 11.8% post: 6.3% empty, 3.7% semantic, 1.8% state). The paper does not evaluate on any adversarial benchmark (InjecAgent, MCPTox, AgentDojo, ASB) and requires hand-authored logical predicates per tool.

Relevant to Our Idea:
ToolGate is our **closest system and High-threat baseline (B2)** — the only published gate that, like ours, sits *between the agent's decision and tool execution* and enforces a policy before state is updated. It is the direct precedent we reimplement per Appendix G as our comparison gate. The differentiation is sharp and quantitative: same placement, opposite policy source — ToolGate's policy is *hand-authored* Hoare contracts per tool with symbolic world-state (setup cost the paper does not measure), ours is *automatically derived* from the user's own request as a structured intent contract (setup cost 0). And opposite evaluation: ToolGate is evaluated only on task completion (ToolBench/MCP-Universe Pass/Win), never on adversarial injection or poisoning; we will be the first to report contract-style gating ASR on InjecAgent (1,054) and MCPTox (1,312) — the exact benchmarks ToolGate never tested. Their rejection taxonomy (29.4% total, pre vs. post) and efficiency claim (more concise trajectories) are the figures we will directly compare against (our per-call latency vs. their retrieval+verification overhead).

Gap / Limitation Noted in Paper:
Per §6/Limitations: scope is text/structured only (no multimodal, no long-chain multi-step collaborative tasks); static evaluation that does not capture live API dynamics (latency, rate limits, fluctuating data); metrics are quantitative only (need qualitative reasoning assessment); prompt-based bias may not generalize across LLMs. From our perspective, the unaddressed gaps are the critical ones: (1) no adversarial evaluation at all — vulnerability to injection/poisoning is never measured, (2) no setup-cost metric — hand-authoring cost per tool is not quantified, and (3) no FPR/latency reporting at the gate level — only aggregate Pass/Win. Appendix G's formal derivations are provided but the repository at verification time is minimal (2 commits, no README) — fidelity of any reimplementation must be validated on ToolBench subset before adversarial runs, which we explicitly plan in Weeks 3–4.

## Section 2 — Expert Detailed Analysis

### Q1–Q9 Quick Reference

| # | Question | Short Answer |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | What problem and why important? | Tool-augmented LLMs rely on implicit natural-language reasoning to decide when to call tools and whether to trust results — no formal guarantees. Leads to calling with wrong/insufficient params, committing invalid/hallucinated results, corrupting world state, and error propagation over long tool chains. Importance grows as tool counts reach thousands (retrieval challenge) and agents act on real systems. |
| Q2 | What data (source, size, splits, ethics)? | ToolBench (ToolLLM): 16,464 RapidAPI APIs, 49 categories, 126k instruction–solution pairs via DFSDT, classic set 8 envs × ~100 manually verified tasks each (7–15 tools each). MCP-Universe: 231 tasks on 11 real MCP servers across 6 domains (Web Search 55, Location Nav 45, Financial 40, Browser Auto 39, Repo Mgmt 33, 3D Design 19) with 84 evaluators (Format, Static, Dynamic). No train/test for ToolGate — evaluation-only. No human data. Ethics: public APIs/sandboxes, no PII, sandbox execution with licenses followed. |
| Q3 | What features/inputs, how engineered? | Typed symbolic state *S = {(k,v,type)}* (trusted world info). Per-tool Hoare contract `{P} T {Q}`: *P(S)* = minimal state predicate for legal call, *Q(S,r)* = structural/typing/semantic postcondition on result *r* plus how verified *r* updates *S*. Tool requirement representation *q_t* from (query, dialogue history, *S*, trajectory) → embedding retrieval (Qwen3-embedding-0.6B) → Top-k → reranker (Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B) → contract-filtered policy. No learned features beyond embeddings; contracts are hand-authored FOL predicates. |
| Q4 | What methods/models, overall pipeline? | Forward execution with probabilistic reasoning constrained by Hoare logic. Steps: (1) LLM decides to emit `TOOL_CALL` marker via *p(trigger\|query,history,S,trajectory)*, (2) build *q_t*, (3) retrieve Top-k, (4) rerank → *p_rank*, (5) precondition filter: keep only *T* where *S ⊨ P_T*, renormalize → logically valid policy, sample *T**, (6) execute → *r*, (7) postcondition acceptance *accept = 1[S⊨Q(S,r)]* (structural/typing/semantic), (8) if accept, *S' = update(S,r)* and inject `<tool_result>` into trajectory; else discard and backtrack, (9) trajectory marginalization, with global constraint that any precondition/postcondition violation → trajectory probability 0 (Eq 14). Formal derivations in Appendix G (weakest precondition, Hoare triples, soundness theorem). |
| Q5 | What baselines and why chosen? | 5 tool-learning baselines covering planning paradigms: ReAct (thought↔action loop), DFSDT (depth-first search with failure-history replanning), LATS (look-ahead tree search), ToolChain* (A* over tool chains), Tool-Planner (external planner + retrieval/filtering). Covers linear vs. search vs. planner-based. Evaluated across 4 backbones (Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507, DeepSeek V3.2, GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro) to show model-agnostic gain. |
| Q6 | How evaluated (metrics, setup, tests)? | ToolBench: Pass Rate (task completed via ToolEval) + Win Rate (LLM judge compares vs. Qwen-3-235B-ReAct, better = win). MCP-Universe: Success Rate + stability per domain (Location, Repo, Financial) with 84 evaluators (Format/Static/Dynamic). Also: ablation (w/o Hoare, w/o pre, w/o post), tool-calling steps (efficiency), fine-grained rejection distribution (pre vs. post error taxonomy). All models temp 0.2, identical instructions/tool definitions/limits, Top-k default, sandboxed MCP execution with real latency/failure signals. |
| Q7 | Key results vs baselines? | Best across all models/domains: GPT-5.2 ToolGate 85.5/83.5 (G1), 93.0/90.5 (G2), 91.8/95.3 (G3), 57.0 MCP-Avg (35.52 Loc, 45.45 Repo, 90.0 Fin) vs. best baseline ToolChain* 82.8/80, 90.5/88.3, 88.5/92.5, 51.5 (30/39.39/85) — 5–6 point MCP-Avg gain. Similar gains on other backbones (DeepSeek 72.0 vs 68.8 G1). Ablation: w/o Hoare 37.6% MCP-Avg (< DFSDT 38.3% — Hoare is the driver; search without logic is worse than DFSDT); w/o pre −10.8%, w/o post −4.5% (pre more important for efficiency, post for correctness). Rejection 29.4% (17.6% pre, 11.8% post). Efficiency: fewest tool-calling steps, near-optimal path vs. ReAct/Tool-Planner trial-and-error loops. |
| Q8 | Limitations and biases? | Text/structured only, no multimodal/long-chain collaborative tasks; static evaluation not fully capturing live API dynamics (latency, rate limits, fluctuating data); quantitative-only metrics; prompt bias across LLMs; and critically, no adversarial evaluation (injection/poisoning never tested), no setup-cost (contracts per tool) or per-gate FPR/latency reporting. Repository minimal at last check (2 commits, no README). |
| Q9 | Code/data/artifacts available? | https://github.com/OceannTwT/ToolGate (minimal at verification: 2 commits, no README, but Appendix G provides formal algorithm); ToolBench (126k pairs, 8 classic envs) and MCP-Universe (231 tasks, 11 servers) are public; Qwen3-embedding-0.6B + Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B used for retrieval. Reimplementation effort: moderate-high — must author Hoare predicates per tool and symbolic state schema; we scope to evaluated tools only and validate on ToolBench subset first. |

### 2. Core Contribution & Method

**State representation (Eq 2):** Trusted symbolic state *S = {(k,v,type)}* — typed key-value map of verified entities, intermediate results, validated tool outputs. Predicates over *S* express existence, type consistency, invariants; *S ⊨ φ* means state satisfies formula *φ*.

**Contracts (Eq 3):** Each tool *T* has `{P_T} T {Q_T}`. *P_T(S)* is the weakest precondition for legal call — *S ⊨ P_T* must hold or tool is not executable. *Q_T(S,r)* constrains result *r*'s structure, typing, value ranges, semantic consistency, and defines how verified *r* updates *S* via deterministic `update(S,r)`.

**Execution (Eq 9–14):** Retrieval builds *q_t = f(query, history, S, trajectory)* → Top-k via cosine → rerank → *p_rank*. Contract filter: *p_valid(T) ∝ p_rank(T)·1[S⊨P_T]*, renormalized — formally, requiring *S ⊨ wp(T, true)*. Sample *T* ~ p_valid*. Execute → *r*. Acceptance *accept = 1[S⊨Q_T(S,r) ∧ well_formed(r)]* (Eq 11). If accept, *S' = update(S,r)* (Eq 12); else discard entirely (prevents contamination) and backtrack. Full trajectory probability factorizes over trigger, retrieval, ranking, filtering, sampling, acceptance (Eq 13); any violation → trajectory prob 0 (Eq 14) — global safety.

**Formal guarantees (Appendix G):** Soundness obligation (*∀S,r: S⊨P_T ∧ r=exec_T(S) → S'⊨Inv ∧ well_typed(S')*, Eq 15), Hoare derivation rule for ToolGate step, weakest-precondition correspondence (*S⊨P_T ↔ S⊨wp(T, Q)*, Eq 16), postcondition acceptance event (Eq 17–18), trajectory safety (Eq 19–20), and soundness theorem by induction: if all contracts sound and *S₀⊨Inv*, every reachable trajectory is safe (Eq 21). Concrete example instantiates a repo tool with *cwd* and *fs* keys.

**Retrieval (Eq 6–8):** Tool requirement abstraction clarifies expected output; embedding search shrinks thousands of tools to Top-k (default unspecified, ablated), reranker jointly considers reasoning context + *S* + candidate semantics.

**Ablation (MCP-Avg, DeepSeek/GPT-5.2):** Full 38.0/57.0 → w/o Hoare 27.2/37.6 (below DFSDT 27.8/38.3) → w/o post 34.5/52.5 → w/o pre 30.9/46.2. Pre more impactful (−10.8 avg) than post (−4.5) — pre prunes statically, post rectifies logically.

**Rejection distribution (MCP-Universe, all attempts):** Total 29.4% intercepted — Pre 17.6% (Value/Entity Hallucination 8.4%, Schema/Format Violation 5.1%, State Dependency Missing 4.1%), Post 11.8% (Empty/Null 6.3%, Semantic Constraint Mismatch 3.7%, State Update Inconsistency 1.8%). Pre = efficiency (prunes invalid branches), Post = correctness (catches vacuous but "successful" outputs).

**Efficiency:** Fewest average tool-calling steps across backbones; trajectory near-optimal vs. ReAct/Tool-Planner trial-and-error loops; Hoare pruning collapses logically invalid branches.

### 4. Paper's Self-Admitted Limitations

Per §6/Limitations: (1) text/structured only — no multimodal/long-chain collaborative tasks, (2) static evaluation not capturing live dynamics (latency, rate limits, fluctuating data), (3) quantitative-only metrics — need qualitative reasoning and proactive missing-info solicitation assessment, (4) prompt-based bias across LLMs. We add: (5) no adversarial evaluation, (6) no setup-cost metric, (7) minimal repository at verification time.

### 5. Direct Comparison to Our Idea

| Dimension | ToolGate | Our Idea |
|---|---|---|
| **Problem** | Invalid/hallucinated tool calls and result corruption in complex multi-step reasoning (task completion) | Hijacked tool calls via injection/poisoning (security) — same chokepoint, different threat |
| **Gate placement** | Pre (precondition filter) + Post (postcondition acceptance) — two gates framing execution | Pre only (allow/block/escalate before execution) — post is out of scope for hijack (malicious call should not execute at all) |
| **Policy source** | Hand-authored FOL/Hoare predicates per tool over symbolic world-state *S* (typed KV map) — formal, verifiable, but manual | Auto-derived intent contract from user's request (goals, tool categories, data scopes, side-effect limits) + embedding + hard rules — informal, no world-state, but zero per-tool authoring |
| **State** | Explicit trusted *S* that evolves only via verified commits; trajectory-level safety theorem | No persistent world-state — per-call stateless check against frozen intent contract (simpler, stateless, but cannot enforce cross-call invariants like "must read before write") |
| **Evaluation** | ToolBench + MCP-Universe task completion (Pass/Win/Success) — no adversarial | InjecAgent + MCPTox adversarial (ASR/FPR) + latency + setup cost — the evaluation ToolGate never did |
| **Overhead** | Retrieval (embedding+reranker) + FOL checks + symbolic updates | Embedding + rule lookup per call — lighter, no retrieval over thousands of tools, no symbolic state maintenance |
| **Failure mode** | Rejects 29.4% logically invalid calls (hallucinated IDs, missing dependencies, empty results) — catches *capability* errors | Aims to reject hijacked calls even when they are *logically valid* (correct params, existing IDs) but *intent-inconsistent* — catches *security* errors that ToolGate's logic would allow |

**Overlap with C1 (gate mechanism):** High — same placement, same concept of gating execution with a policy. But mechanism is opposite: formal vs. intent-derived, manual vs. automatic, stateful vs. stateless, capability vs. security. No direct duplication; we reimplement ToolGate as B2 to make the comparison head-to-head.

**Overlap with C2 (evaluation):** None — ToolGate is task-completion only. Our evaluation is the *first* adversarial test of contract-style gating, which is itself a contribution.

### 6. Our Positioning Strategy

| Role | Detail |
|---|---|
| **In our paper** | Closest (System) — High threat to novelty; baseline B2 (ToolGate reimplementation per Appendix G) |
| **How we cite** | As "the first forward-execution, Hoare-contract tool gate (typed symbolic state, pre/post verification, 29.4% rejection, trajectory safety theorem; best on ToolBench/MCP-Universe but evaluated only on task completion, never on adversarial injection/poisoning; requires hand-authored predicates per tool)" — we compare auto intent vs. manual contracts on the benchmarks it never tested |
| **Relationship** | Direct competitor on mechanism (gate) but not on evaluation — we do the cross-paper experiment the ToolGate paper explicitly leaves open |

**Pre-emptive rebuttal paragraph** (if reviewer asks "how is this different from ToolGate?"):
> ToolGate is the closest published gate and our direct baseline. Both sit between the agent's decision and tool execution and both enforce a policy before state is corrupted. The difference is policy source and evaluation, not placement. ToolGate's policy is a set of hand-authored Hoare contracts `{P}T{Q}` over a typed symbolic world-state that must be maintained and updated — formally verifiable but requiring manual predicates per tool and evaluated only on task completion (ToolBench Pass/Win, MCP-Universe Success). Our policy is a structured intent contract automatically derived from the user's own request (no per-tool authoring) and checked per call via embedding similarity plus hard side-effect rules — informal but zero-setup, stateless, and evaluated adversarially on the injection and poisoning benchmarks ToolGate never tested (InjecAgent 1,054, MCPTox 1,312). We reimplement ToolGate per its Appendix G and report both gates head-to-head on those benchmarks, including the setup-cost (contracts per tool: manual vs. 0) and per-call latency that ToolGate's paper does not measure. The two approaches are not mutually exclusive: intent gating could serve as the zero-setup front gate, with formal contracts added later for persistent state invariants.

### 7. Code & Reproducibility

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Repo** | https://github.com/OceannTwT/ToolGate |
| **Status at verification** | Minimal (2 commits, no README/description) — usable but under-documented; committed pipeline-output JSONs suggest runnable setup |
| **Language** | Python (Hoare predicates + Qwen3-embedding-0.6B + Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B, temp 0.2) |
| **Datasets** | ToolBench (16,464 APIs, 49 categories, 126k pairs, 8 classic envs) + MCP-Universe (231 tasks, 11 real MCP servers, 84 evaluators) |
| **LLMs used** | Qwen3-235B, DeepSeek V3.2, GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro |
| **Compute** | No training; retrieval + verification per step |
| **License** | Not stated — assume research-use |
| **Reimplementation effort** | Moderate-high — must translate Appendix G per evaluated tool; we scope to InjecAgent+MCPTox tool subsets and validate on ToolBench subset before adversarial runs; Appendix G provides exact algorithm but predicate authoring is manual |
| **Key challenge** | Faithful FOL predicate authoring and symbolic state schema; Appendix G formal derivations are the spec |

### 8. Cross-References

| Paper in this review | Relationship |
|---|---|
| **AgentDojo (Debenedetti et al., 2024)** | Predecessor benchmark — AgentDojo's tool filter is an informal allowlist gate; ToolGate is its formal successor (Hoare contracts). Both are gates, but AgentDojo's is evaluated adversarially (7.5% ASR) while ToolGate's is not — we bridge this by evaluating ToolGate adversarially. |
| **InjecAgent (Zhan et al., 2024)** | Evaluation substrate ToolGate never used — we will report ToolGate's ASR on InjecAgent's 1,054 cases; InjecAgent's user-case content-freedom finding (high-freedom more vulnerable) maps to ToolGate's hallucination category (8.4% value hallucination) — different error types but same need for per-call validation. |
| **MCPTox (Wang et al., 2025)** | Evaluation substrate ToolGate never used — MCPTox is live MCP servers, which overlaps with ToolGate's MCP-Universe (11 real MCP servers) but tests poisoning vs. task completion; ToolGate's retrieval over thousands of tools is directly relevant to MCP scale, but its contracts would need authoring for MCPTox's 353 tools (setup cost we count). |
| **ASB (Zhang et al., 2025)** | Superset — ASB's 27-method, 13-backbone breadth shows ToolGate's task-completion SOTA does not imply security (ASB mixed 84% ASR); ASB's formalization in §3 mirrors ToolGate's Hoare formalization in Appendix G — both use FOL, but for different stages (ASB for attacks, ToolGate for defense). |

### 9. Relevance to Thesis

★★★★★ (Critical — closest system, High threat)

**Justification:** ToolGate is the *only* published system that gates at the same point we do, with a formal alternative to our informal approach and a precise algorithm (Appendix G) we can reimplement as a fair baseline. Its SOTA task-completion results establish credibility for the "gate at the tool" idea, while its lack of adversarial evaluation and its manual per-tool cost are the exact gaps our thesis exploits: zero-setup intent vs. hand-authored contracts, and adversarial ASR vs. Pass/Win. Every team member must read §3–4 and Appendix G before Week 3, and the gate implementer must be able to explain Eq 9–14. Mandatory in related work as "the contract-grounded alternative" and in evaluation as B2.
